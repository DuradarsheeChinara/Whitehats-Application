# Whitehats-Application
Why you should take Duradarshee Chinara in your club.

## Name:- Duradarshee Chinara 

## I want to join whitehats club to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity and practical exposure to it as this is something one cant learn from textbooks. I'm exploring my interests and grasping knowledge in every domain I can, as my key driving force is curiosity. I've always been fascinated about loopholes, exploitation and bending rules as it piques my creativity to come up with viable solutions. I believe that being a part of the whitehats club would allow me to collaborate with like minded peers, gain hands on experience , build a strong foundation in ethical hacking and discover more about the world of cybersecurity.

## Cybersecurity Incident that intiated my interest.

One cybersecurity incident I recently revisited was the ILOVEYOU virus (also known as the Love Bug). It spread through email with a subject line that appeared harmless and tricked users into opening a malicious attachment. Once executed, it spread rapidly and caused billions in damages worldwide. This incident shows how social engineering can be more powerful than technical exploits and highlights the importance of user awareness in cybersecurity. (My mother told me about it at a very young age)
